        # Important: Update [apy_lite](https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/CS6682-Spring2021/apylite)!!!
        I've added features that are used in this assignment, so update or re-download apy_lite.
        
        # Part 1: PointLine
        Complete the notebook [./notebooks/FunWithCrossProducts.ipynb](./notebooks/FunWithCrossProducts.ipynb) by filling in the functions `circumcenter(A,B,C)` and `perpBisect(P1,P2)` (in the notebook itself). The end of the notebook will save images in `./pointline_outputs`. Download the notebook as html and add it to the `./pointline_outputs` directory with the images, then zip the directory up and submit it separately.
        
        
        # Part 2: Audio
        Note: Example outputs for the audio notebooks can be found in [./notebooks/example_solutions/](./notebooks/example_solutions/).
